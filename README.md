# My files for Void Linux

Here are my configuration files for Void Linux. See also:
- https://voidlinux.org/
- https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki/VoidLinux

There are currently several top-based folders
- for base system additions please see [base/](base/)
- for Jenkins CI setup please see [jenkins/](jenkins/)

> [!WARNING]
> Jenkins is unable to install Any plugin, because Jenkins package version is too outdated (and
> online plugin repository requires higher Jenkins version than installed).
> 
> I have yet to find how to create new up-to-date package...
